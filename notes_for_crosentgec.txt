###### prepare_data.sh

###### Lang8
I. langid (py3) is needed.

###### NUCLE
I. nltk for python2 is needed. pip2 is not in the repo of Ubuntu20.04 and it's a problem for running data preparation scripts in the crosentgec repo. Using ubuntu 19.10 in vmware is a solution.

	(1) release3.2 -> release3.3

IV. punkt/english.pickle is needed. Download it from github of nltk.
